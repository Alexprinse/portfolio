## 🚀 **Your Portfolio Is Ready!**

All your social media links and email are now properly integrated throughout your portfolio. When visitors click on:

- **GitHub buttons** → They'll go to `https://github.com/Alexprinse`
- **LinkedIn buttons** → They'll go to `https://www.linkedin.com/in/shalembakthsingh/`
- **Email buttons** → They'll open their email client to `princebadampudi@gmail.com`
- **Project "Code" buttons** → They'll go to your specific GitHub repositories

The configuration is centralized in `src/lib/config.ts`, so if you ever need to update any links in the future, you only need to change them in one place!

Your portfolio is now complete and ready for deployment! 🌟
